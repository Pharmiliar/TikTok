# TikTok
TikTok is a case study in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate course

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model to determine whether a video on TikTok contains a claim or offers an opinion, aiming to streamline the
content moderation process. The project utilized machine learning techniques to analyze user-reported videos and comments. The final model achieved an accuracy of 85%, providing TikTok
with a valuable tool to prioritize and address user reports efficiently.

## Business Understanding

TikTok faces the challenge of effectively moderating user-generated content, particularly in identifying videos that contain claims or opinions. With a large volume of user
reports to process, TikTok aims to develop a predictive model to automate and expedite the content moderation process. By accurately predicting whether a video contains a claim or
opinion, TikTok can allocate resources more efficiently and maintain a safe and enjoyable platform for its users.

## Data Understanding

The project utilized data collected from user reports on TikTok, consisting of information about reported videos and comments. The dataset included features such as video
content, comments, timestamps, and user interactions. Exploratory data analysis revealed patterns and trends in reported content, helping to identify key factors for predicting whether a
video contains a claim or opinion. Data limitations may include biases in reporting and labeling, requiring careful preprocessing and validation to ensure model accuracy.

## Modeling and Evaluation

Various machine learning models, including logistic regression and random forest, were trained and evaluated to predict whether a video contains a claim or opinion.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess model performance. The final model achieved an accuracy of 85%, demonstrating strong predictive
capabilities. Feature importance analysis identified key indicators of claim-containing content, providing insights for further model refinement and content moderation strategies.

## Conclusion

The predictive model developed in this project offers TikTok a valuable tool for automating and improving the content moderation process. By accurately identifying videos containing
claims or opinions, TikTok can prioritize user reports more effectively and maintain a safe and engaging platform for its users. Recommendations include ongoing monitoring and refinement
of the model to adapt to evolving content trends and user behaviors. Future steps may involve integrating additional data sources and incorporating user feedback to enhance model
performance and reliability.
